## Development Setup

Ready to write some code, add a sound effect, a graphic or music that you created? Hereâ€™s how to get the project running on your local machine.

1.  **Install Godot:** Download and install the latest stable version of the **Godot Engine (version 4.x)**. You can get it for free from the [official website](https://godotengine.org/download/).

2.  **Fork the Repository:** Click the "Fork" button at the top right of the [Shooter Carnival GitHub page](https://github.com/HouZenKai/ShooterCarnival). This creates a copy of the project under your own GitHub account.

3.  **Clone Your Fork:** Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command, replacing `YOUR-USERNAME` with your GitHub username:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/ShooterCarnival.git
    ```

4.  **Open the Project in Godot:**
    *   Launch the Godot Engine.
    *   In the Project Manager, click the "Import" button.
    *   Navigate to the `ShooterCarnival/src` folder you just cloned and select the `project.godot` file.
    *   The project will now appear in your project list. Double-click it to open.

You're all set! You can now run the game and start making changes or adding assets.

## Contribution Workflow

1.  **Create a New Branch:** Before you start contributing, create a new branch for your changes. This keeps your work organized.
    ```bash
    git checkout -b your-feature-or-fix-name
    ```

2.  **Make Your Changes:** Write your code, create your assets, and save your work in the Godot editor.

3.  **Commit Your Changes:** Once you're happy with your changes, commit them with a clear and descriptive message.
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "#63 Implemented the Laser weapon power-up"
    ```
    *We recommend using a convention like #<issue number> verb *

4.  **Push to Your Fork:** Push your new branch up to your fork on GitHub.
    ```bash
    git push origin your-feature-or-fix-name
    ```

5.  **Open a Pull Request:** Go to your fork on GitHub. You'll see a prompt to "Compare & pull request". Click it, give your PR a clear title and description, and submit it for review!

## Foundational Knowledge - Recommended Learning

New to Godot? No problem! We've gathered some of the best tutorials to help you understand the core concepts we use in this project. The "Hook" of our project is that **if you know Python, you can write GDScript!** These resources will bridge the gap.

We also point to specific tutorials in each sprint that are relevant to work being done.

### Getting Started

*   **Core Tutorial:** [Your First 2D Game](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/first_2d_game/index.html) (Dodge the Creeps). This is the "Hello, World!" of Godot and is the best place to start.

### Fundamental Godot Concepts
