# Purpose

This file tracks all third-party assets included or referenced by Shooter Carnival:
sprites, sprite-sheets, tilemaps, fonts, backgrounds, icons, music, and sound effects.
For each asset we record author, license, source URL, local path (if added to repo),
and the exact attribution text required by the license.

## How to use

1. When you add an asset, create a new entry below.
2. If the license requires attribution (e.g., CC-BY), copy the exact attribution string.
3. If the asset disallows commercial use, it will conflict with the project's license and shall not be used unless a commercial use approval was given.

## Checklist when adding an asset

- [ ] Confirm license (copy license URL or license text to this file).
- [ ] Verify whether commercial use is allowed.
- [ ] If attribution is required, add the exact attribution line to the "Attribution / Notes" column.
- [ ] Add a small `license.txt` file in the same folder as the asset containing the license link and author name.
- [ ] If an asset's license is incompatible with the project's license, do NOT add it without explicit approval from maintainers.

## Quick guidelines (recommendations)

- Prefer CC0 / public-domain / permissive assets (Kenney, some itch.io packs) for sprites and backgrounds.
- Prefer Google Fonts or SIL/Open Font License (OFL) fonts for UI text.
- For music and SFX, prefer CC0 / CC-BY or dedicated game-music permissive licenses (check each file).
- Avoid "No Derivatives (ND)" licensed art if you need to modify it.
- If an asset is NonCommercial (NC), note it clearly — our project uses dual CC BY-NC-SA and commercial license (see LICENSE).

## Contact / Questions

If you're unsure about an asset's license compatibility, open an issue in the repository and tag `license-question`. Do not merge assets with ambiguous or conflicting licenses.
