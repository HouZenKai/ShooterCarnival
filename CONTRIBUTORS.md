# Thank you

This project thrives because of you. Every commit, every line of documentation, and every conversation in an issue tracker builds the foundation of what we create together. We believe that contribution comes in countless forms—and all of them are vital.

Whether you generously shared your time debugging a tricky problem, offered your expertise to steer us toward a better architectural choice, or contributed tangible code that brought a new feature to life, you are an essential part of the HouZenKai community.

Your input — large or small, technical or conceptual — is the real treasure that keeps this community moving at full throttle.
